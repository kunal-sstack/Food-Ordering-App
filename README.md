# Food-Ordering-App
This project is an end-to-end Food Ordering Web Application built with Spring Boot and React.js, ensuring seamless user experiences for both clients and admins. On the backend, Spring Boot is secured with JWT-based authentication and robust Spring Security to protect endpoints. The API delivers CRUD functionalities for foods, orders, and users. Client-side, React.js and JavaScript power an engaging UI for browsing, ordering, and tracking deliveries. We integrated Razorpay for secure and efficient payments. AWS is used for hosting, ensuring scalability. The admin panel manages orders and statuses, while clients can explore menus and place orders, creating a complete and modern ordering solution.
